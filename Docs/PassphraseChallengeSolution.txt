Git keeps asking me for my ssh key passphrase
Ask Question
416

I'm using Linux and I created keys as instructed in the github tutorial, registered them with github, and tried using ssh-agent explicitly — yet git continues to ask me for my passphrase every time I try to do a pull or a push.

SOLUTION:

From git bash, enter:

eval $(ssh-agent)

ssh-add

    This will ask you your passphrase just once, and then you should be allowed to push, provided that you uploaded the public key to Github.

    To save key permanently:

ssh-add -k 

    This will persist it after you close and re-open it by storing it in user's keychain.
